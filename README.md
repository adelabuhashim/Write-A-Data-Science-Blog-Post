## Project Motivation

**Data Science requires**
- Curiosity.
- Data.
- Code.
- Communication.
- Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

In this project I'm going to apply **CRISP-DM**(CRoss Industry Standard Process)  which contains 6 steps:

1. Business Undestanding.
2. Data Understanding.
3. Preparing Data.
4. Data Modeling.
5. Evaluate Results.
6. Deplyment.

>In this project; I used  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston">Boston AirBNB Data from kaggle</a>.
>This dataset can be used to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames. 

***Quetions***
1. Q1: What is the availabilitya and price ternd of homes in Boston?
2. Q2: Which columns has effect on the price?
3. Q3: Top Reviewers?


## Data files <a name="files"></a>
